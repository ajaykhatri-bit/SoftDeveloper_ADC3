The "Liskov's Substitution Principle" is just a way of ensuring that
inheritance is used correctly.

Ostrich is a Bird (definitely it is!) and hence it inherits the Bird class.
Now, can it fly?
So, even if in real world this seems natural, in the class design, Ostrich
should not inherit the Bird class, and there should be a separate class
for birds that can't really fly and Ostrich should inherit that.
