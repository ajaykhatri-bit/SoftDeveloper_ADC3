The Single Responsibilty Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. Martin suggests that
we define each responsibility of a class as a reason for change.  If you can think of more than one motivation for
changing a class, it probably has more than one responsibility. 
Some examples of responsibilities to consider that may need to be separated include:
-Persistence
-Validation
-Notification
-Error Handling
-Logging
-Class Selection / Instantiation
-Formatting
-Parsing
-Mapping
